                        <p className="mt-2">It most certainly will! More people are accessing the web via small screens than ever, and the trend is likely to carry on. If your site doesn’t display or work properly on a mobile or tablet screen, you risk losing a big chunk of your potential audience. It means mobile responsive web design is essential these days. Every website we create is mobile responsive.</p>
